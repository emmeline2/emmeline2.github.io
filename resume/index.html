    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <DL>
        <DT>Embedded Software Engineer at Rockwell Automation (Cleveland, OH) July 2019 to July 2022</DT>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed safety and security critical embedded software features in C++ for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) as part of a 6 person agile development team.</li>
            <li>Designed and developed firmware features in real-time, multi-threaded systems, for high availability industrial automation products, which increase controllers' reliability and maintainability.</li>
            <li>Implemented automated functional tests, development tests, and unit tests in parallel with software development to verify firmware functionality and quality. Testware was written in python and C++.</li>
            <li>Debugged and troubleshooted firmware using an on-chip debug interface (Lauterbach Trace32).</li>
        </ul>
        <DT>Software Engineer Intern at Cerner Corporation (Kansas City, MO) May to August 2018</DT>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed an OAuth secured login page and enforcement system for an internal development web API uplift using Java, JSP, and Spring framework as a member of an Agile/Scrum development team.</li>
            <li>The internal web API monitored patient insurance processing and claims tracking.</li>
            <li>Presented work at the end of the summer in a cross-group meeting with members from the Kansas City, Malvern, and Bangalore partner teams.</li>     
            <li>Mentored a high school student through learning Java to start his own project.</li>
        </ul>
        <DT>Undergraduate Researcher in Medical Device Development (Cleveland, OH) January 2017 to May 2019</DT>
        <ul>
            <li>Biomedical Imaging Department, Case Western Reserve University</li>
            <li>Advanced a prototype for a more efficient device for Cystic Fibrosis detection in infants. </li>
            <li>Created a more precise data processing technique using sovitsky-golay filtering and parabolic interpolation to generate a smoother curve fit and more accurate output concentration values. </li>
            <li>Translated the data processing code from MATLAB and Arduino based into embedded C. This allowed the device to be compacted to a handheld device which used a microprocessor rather than a computer.</li>
        </ul>
