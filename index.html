	<p>
		I graduated from Case Western Reserve University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2019. I then worked for three years
		as an embedded software engineer at Rockwell Automation. At Rockwell I developed firmware and testware for Programable Logic
		controllers(PLCs) and I/O devices. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As a software developer I enjoy using technology to solve problems to make people's lives better. I am intersted in how technology
		can be applied to clean energy and waste reduction applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside of programming I enjoy being active outdoors, rowing, running, skiing, and hiking. I have also been enjoying
		experimenting with sourdough and walking dogs at my local dog shelter.
