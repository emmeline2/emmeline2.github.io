				I graduated from Case Western Reserve University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2019. After graduating, I worked for three years
				as an embedded software engineer at Rockwell Automation developing firmware and testware for Programable Logic
				controllers(PLCs) and I/O devices. I started my master's in September, 2022 and expect to graduate in December, 2023.

			<p>
				As a software developer, I enjoy using technology to solve problems to make people's lives better. I am intersted in how technology
				can be applied to clean energy and waste reduction applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of programming I enjoy being active outdoors, rowing, running, skiing, and hiking. I have also been enjoying
				experimenting with sourdough and walking dogs at my local dog shelter.
