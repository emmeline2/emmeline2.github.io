		I graduated from Case Western Reserve University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2019. After graduating, I worked for three years
		as an embedded software engineer at Rockwell Automation developing firmware and testware for Programable Logic
		controllers(PLCs) and I/O devices. I started my master's in September, 2022 and expect to graduate in December, 2023.

		As a software developer I enjoy using technology to solve problems to make people's lives better. I am intersted in how technology
		can be applied to clean energy and waste reduction applications.

	<p>
		Outside of programming I enjoy being active outdoors, rowing, running, skiing, and hiking. I have also been enjoying
		experimenting with sourdough and walking dogs at my local dog shelter.
